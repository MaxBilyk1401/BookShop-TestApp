# BookShop-TestApp
Hello everyone!
Today I'm presenting my test project that I've been working on for the past week. It's a small bookshop app where you can browse different book categories, select a specific book, and purchase it on Amazon.

Technical stacks used: UIKit, MVVM acrhitecture with closures, auto layout programatically, DRY, KISS, SOLID, Combine.

Additional main libraries: Moya and Kingfisher.
