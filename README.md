Hello everyone!

Today, I'm presenting my test project that I've been working on for the past week. It's a small bookshop app where you can browse different book categories, select a specific book, and make a purchase on Amazon.

Technical stacks used: UIKit, MVVM architecture with closures, auto layout programmatically, DRY, KISS, SOLID, CoreData.

Supported devices: iPhone, iPad. Portrait and landscape orientations.

Additional main libraries: Moya and Kingfisher.
